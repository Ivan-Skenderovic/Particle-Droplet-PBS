# Particle-Droplet-PBS

This software calculates particle accumulation -and growth inside droplets in the framework of population-balance simulations. 
First, the user sets the required material properties in the 'ConfigSettings.m' files. The software is run by executing the 'main.m' script in the respective folder. 
Two standalone case studies are provided as a demonstration. The simulation results are provided in the form of a particle size distribution, among other statistics, in a 'xxx.csv' file. 
Its' filename contains material parameters set by the user. The output file is stored inside the 'results' folder.
